## 1. Architecture Overview

> _Full diagram to be completed in Session 11._

**Services at a glance:**

```
Client

## 2. Decisions Log

> _Full table to be completed in Session 11. See `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md` for the complete log._

| Decision | Choice |
|----------|--------|
| Users | Single-user MVP, multi-user ready (`user_id` on every entity) |
| Auth | JWT access token (15 min) + refresh token in HttpOnly cookie (7 days) |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 — one instance, one schema per service |
| Build | Maven multi-module — all versions pinned in parent `pom.xml` |
| Frontend | Angular 18 PWA — installable on Android, no offline caching |
| Styling | Tailwind utility classes only — no component libraries |
| Analytics | Pre-calculated metrics only — HTTP fire-and-forget from training-service |

## 3. Domain Model

> _Full ERD to be completed in Session 11. See `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md` for entity definitions._

**training-service entities:** `Exercise`, `ExerciseBodyPartTarget`, `TrainingProgram`,
`WeekTemplate`, `DayTemplate`, `DayExercise`, `WorkoutSession`, `WorkoutSet`

**analytics-service entities (derived, read-only):** `WeeklyVolumeSnapshot`, `ExerciseProgressEntry`

## 4. Body Parts Reference

Fixed Java enum — no table, no CRUD:

```
CHEST, BACK, SHOULDERS, BICEPS, TRICEPS,
QUADS, HAMSTRINGS, GLUTES, CALVES, CORE, FOREARMS, TRAPS
```

## 5. Local Development Setup

> _Step-by-step guide to be completed in Session 11._

**Prerequisites:** Java 21, Maven 3.9.x, Docker, Docker Compose, Node 20

**Quick start:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JSR-Mario/training-app.git
cd training-app
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — fill in all values before starting
docker-compose up
```

**Dev mode** (exposes all internal ports, activates `dev` Spring profile):

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

## 6. Environment Variables

> _Full reference table to be completed in Session 11. See [.env.example](.env.example) for all variables and descriptions._

## 7. API Reference

> _To be completed in Session 11._

Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html` (available once full stack is running).

## 10. CI/CD Pipeline

> _Full documentation to be completed in Session 11._

**CI** (`ci.yml`) runs on every push and pull request to `develop` or `main`:
- `backend` job: `mvn verify` — compiles all modules and runs all tests.
- `frontend` job: `npm ci` + `npm run build` + `npm run lint` — skips automatically until Session 7 adds `frontend/package.json`.

**CD** (`cd.yml`, added in Session 11): triggers on merge to `main` — builds Docker images, pushes to GHCR, deploys to Antigravity.

### Git Workflow

```
main          ← production. Protected. CD triggers here.
develop       ← integration. Protected. All sessions merge here first.
feat/session-N-* ← one branch per session (agent creates these).
fix/*         ← bug fixes branched from develop.
chore/*       ← infra, config, tooling changes.
docs/*        ← documentation-only changes.
```

**Per-session flow:**
1. Agent creates `feat/session-N-*` from `develop`, does the work, pushes.
2. You open a PR: `feat/*` → `develop`.
3. CI must pass before merge.
4. You merge and delete the branch (enabled via repo settings).
5. Repeat for the next session.

**Production release** (Session 11 only):
1. You open a PR: `develop` → `main`.
2. CI passes → you merge → CD deploys automatically.
